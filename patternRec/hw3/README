Running instructions:

KNN:
Dependencies apart from the standard stuff -- I use the metric-learn module
(https://github.com/all-umass/metric-learn) for metric learning using LMNN and
the bottleneck module (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Bottleneck) for partitioning
the distances to the training set about the k-th element.

These are the three ipython notebooks:
knn_wine
knn_mnist
knn_office

HMM:
There is one ipython notebook:
hmm

Common instructions:
Run each of the notebooks from top to bottom (run all cells) for the desired
results for the corresponding dataset. Change the folder structure in
dataSetManager.py in case you have a different directory structure from the
following:

hw3
  MNIST
  office
  wine
  Robot
