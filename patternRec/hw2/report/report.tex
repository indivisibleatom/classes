\section{Random forests}
\subsection{Wine-dataset}
For the wine dataset, I selected a random subset of size 75\% of the original data
for training. I did not ensure that the samples in the training set are equally
distributed for each label. While this is sub-optimal as mentioned by the
instructor on Piazza, I think the split of {33\%, 40\%, 27\%} amongst the classes
is not substantial to adversely affect the results.
